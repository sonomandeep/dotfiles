# Dotfiles Bootstrap (Fedora)

One-command setup for a fresh Fedora machine.

This installer configures a complete terminal/dev environment with:

- Zsh + Oh My Zsh (`zsh-syntax-highlighting`, `zsh-autosuggestions`)
- Starship prompt
- Tmux + TPM
- Neovim
- Lazygit
- Go
- Volta (Node.js toolchain manager)
- Bun

## Requirements

- Fedora / DNF-based Linux
- A regular user with `sudo` privileges (**do not run as root**)
- Internet connection
- `curl` installed

## Quick Install

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonomandeep/dotfiles/main/install.sh)
```

Verbose mode:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonomandeep/dotfiles/main/install.sh) --verbose
```

Help:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonomandeep/dotfiles/main/install.sh) --help
```

## What the Script Does

- Installs base dependencies via `dnf`
- Clones this repo into `~/.dotfiles` (or pulls latest if already present)
- Installs/configures Zsh + Oh My Zsh + plugins
- Installs Starship, Tmux, TPM, Neovim, Lazygit, Go, Volta, Bun
- Creates symlinks:
  - `~/.config/nvim` -> `~/.dotfiles/nvim`
  - `~/.config/tmux` -> `~/.dotfiles/tmux`
  - `~/.config/starship.toml` -> `~/.dotfiles/starship.toml`
- Backs up existing symlink targets as `.bak`
- Writes `~/.zshrc`
- Sets Zsh as default shell

## Important Notes

- This script is Fedora-only (`dnf` required).
- `~/.zshrc` is regenerated by the installer.
- Existing config targets are backed up before being replaced.

## After Installation

1. Start a new shell session or run:

   ```bash
   exec zsh
   ```

2. Open tmux and press `<prefix> + I` to install TPM plugins.
3. Open Neovim (`nvim`) to trigger first-time plugin setup.
4. Install Node.js via Volta:

   ```bash
   volta install node
   ```

5. Verify Bun:

   ```bash
   bun --version
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- Re-run with `--verbose` for full output.
- If changing default shell fails, run:

  ```bash
  chsh -s "$(which zsh)" "$USER"
  ```

- If dotfiles pull fails due to local changes, check `~/.dotfiles` status and retry.
